 create table in db "refreshTokens" with {id:rdm string,userTo: link to user id table,}
 
when logging into frontend : create new refreshToken and accessToken store both in the cookies and finally store the new refreshToken in the db

foreach user frontend request : get tokens from cookies, if accessToken is not expired and is valid : proceed the request, if accessToken not valid / expired : try to generate a new one with the refreshToken , if refreshToken is not in the db , throw error : forbidden , if refreshToken is valid : generate a new accessToken and proceed the request

in backend: check foreach request if accessToken is valid/expired , if expired, try to regenerate a new accessToken if refreshToken is in the db



when user logout : delete refreshToken from the db and delete all tokens in cookies

time for each tokens:
refreshToken: unlimited time, depends on db if exist or not
accessToken: between 10-45mn
